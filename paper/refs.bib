	abstract = {Origin–destination datasets representing millions of travel desire lines and routes are common in transport planning, but visualising such datasets is challenging. Existing methods often produce illegible results, low spatial resolution, or only a relative indication of the variation of flow on each road. This paper presents a new open-source algorithm called overline along with an accompanying method, to efficiently convert disparate geographical transport data into a policy-relevant summary form. Specifically, overline aggregates many individual routes into a route network map. These vector and raster maps provide total flow counts for each road and junction and are scalable to regional or national datasets. The method is demonstrated by visualising four million routes for a publicly accessible web mapping application, the Propensity to Cycle Tool, across the whole of England and Wales.},

	abstract = {Geometric-based matching identifies corresponding objects in multi-representation datasets using geometric and topological properties. The criteria used in the matching process encounter ambiguities in some cases, which cause to reducing accuracy of matching in identifying corresponding paired objects. This paper aims to present a descriptor, named as Rotary summation based on orientation and distance, which can be used as a criterion in linear object matching to improve the matching results along with other geometric and topological criteria. The proposed descriptor, which is based on distance and orientation, identifies undetectable corresponding objects through other criteria by taking account the spatial relations between the objects and extracted landmarks in datasets of different scales and sources. The efficiency of the proposed descriptor in improvement of the accuracy of matching is evaluated by six datasets with different scales from two different areas. The results show improvements in matching by considering the proposed descriptor such that the F score value increases on average by 5.48\% in the studying datasets.},

	abstract = {Spatial data conflation involves the matching and merging of counterpart features in multiple datasets. It has applications in practical spatial analysis in a variety of fields. Conceptually, the feature‐matching problem can be viewed as an optimization problem of seeking a match plan that minimizes the total discrepancy between datasets. In this article, we propose a powerful yet efficient optimization model for feature matching based on the classic network flow problem in operations research. We begin with a review of the existing optimization‐based methods and point out limitations of current models. We then demonstrate how to utilize the structure of the network‐flow model to approach the feature‐matching problem, as well as the important factors for designing optimization‐based conflation models. The proposed model can be solved by general linear programming solvers or network flow solvers. Due to the network flow formulation we adopt, the proposed model can be solved in polynomial time. Computational experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing optimization‐based conflation models. We conclude with a summary of findings and point out directions of future research.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a high-level review of different approaches for spatial interpolation using areal features. It groups these into those that use ancillary data to constrain or guide the interpolation (dasymetric, statistical, streetweighted, and point-based), and those do not but instead develop and refine allocation procedures (area to point, pycnophylactic, and areal weighting). Each approach is illustrated by being applied to the same case study. The analysis is extended to examine the opportunities arising from the many new forms of spatial data that are generated by everyday activities such as social media, check-ins, websites offering services, microblogging sites, and social sensing, as well as intentional VGI activities, both supported by ubiquitous web- and GPS-enabled technologies. Here, data of residential properties from a commercial website was used as ancillary data. Overall, the interpolations using many of the new forms of data perform as well as traditional, formal data, highlighting the analytical opportunities as ancillary information for spatial interpolation, and for supporting spatial analysis more generally. However, the case study also highlighted the need to consider the completeness and representativeness of such data. The R code used to generate the data, to develop the analysis and to create the tables and figures is provided.},
