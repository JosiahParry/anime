# ANIME: Approximate Network Integration, Matching, and Enrichment

ANIME is an algorithm that is used to identify partial matching and
attribute transfer between two sets of linestrings.

The core algorithm is implemented in `anime` Rust crate ([see Rust
docs](https://docs.rs/anime/)). The algorithm also comes with R bindings
(which are a work in progress as of this writing).
